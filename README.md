What?
=====

A simple Graphite dashboard built using Twitters Bootstrap.

Adding new dashboards is very easy and individual graphs is
described using a small DSL.

See the _sample_ directory for an example dashboard including
a screenshot.

Config?
-------

This dashboard is a Sinatra application, I suggest deploying it
in Passenger or other Sinatra application server.

A sample _gdash.yaml-sample_ is included, you should rename it to
_gdash.yaml_ and adjust the url to your Graphite etc in there.

The SinatraApp class take two required arguments:

    * Where graphite is installed
    * The directory that has your _dashboards_ directory full of templates

and additional options:

    * The title to show at the top of your Graphite
    * A prefix to prepend to all URLs in the dashboard
    * How many columns of graphs to create, 2 by default.
    * How often dashboard page is refreshed, 60 sec by default.
    * The width of the graphs, 500 by default
    * The height of the graphs, 250 by default
    * Where your whisper files are stored - future use
    * Optional interval quick filters

Creating Dashboards?
--------------------

You can have multiple top level categories of dashboard.  Just create directories
in the _templatedir_ for each top level category.

In each top level category create a sub directory with a short name for each new dashboard.

You need a file called _dash.yaml_ for each dashboard, here is a sample:

    :name: Email Metrics
    :description: Hourly metrics for the email system

Then create descriptions in files like _cpu.graph_ in the same directory, here
is a sample:

    title       "Combined CPU Usage"
    vtitle      "percent"
    area        :stacked
    description "The combined CPU usage for all Exim Anti Spam servers"

    field :iowait, :scale => 0.001,
                   :color => "red",
                   :alias => "IO Wait",
                   :data  => "sumSeries(derivative(mw*munin.cpu.iowait))"

    field :system, :scale => 0.001,
                   :color => "orange",
                   :alias => "System",
                   :data  => "sumSeries(derivative(mw*.munin.cpu.system))"

    field :user, :scale => 0.001,
                 :color => "yellow",
                 :alias => "User",
                 :data  => "sumSeries(derivative(mw*.munin.cpu.user))"

The dashboard will use the _description_ field to show popup information bubbles
when someone hovers over a graph with their mouse for 2 seconds.

The graphs are described using a DSL that has its own project and documented
over at https://github.com/ripienaar/graphite-graph-dsl/wiki

At the moment we do not support the _Related Items_ feature of the DSL.

Custom Time Intervals?
--------------------

You can reuse your dashboards and adjust the time interval by using the following url
structure:

    http://gdash.example.com/dashboard/email/time/-8d/-7d

or

    http://gdash.example.com/dashboard/email/?from=-8d&until=-7d
    http://gdash.example.com/dashboard/email/full/2/600/300?from=-8d&until=-7d

This will display the _email_ dashboard with a time interval same day last week.
If you hit */dashboard/email/time/* it will default to the past hour (*-1hour*)
See http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/1.0/url-api.html#from-until for more info 
acceptable *from* and *until* values.

Quick interval filters shown in interface are configurable in _gdash.yaml_ options sections. Eg:

	:options:
      :interval_filters:
        - :label: Last Hour
          :from: -1h
          :to: now
        - :label: Last Day
          :from: -1day
        - :label: Current Week
          :from: monday
          :to: now

Quick filter is not shown when *interval_filters* section is missing in configuration file.

Time Intervals Display?
-----------------------

If you configure time intervals in the config file you can click on any graph in
the main dashboard view and get a view with different time intervals of the same
graph

	:options:
	  :intervals:
	    - [ "-1hour", "1 hour" ]
	    - [ "-2hour", "2 hour" ]
	    - [ "-1day", "1 day" ]
	    - [ "-1month", "1 month" ]
	    - [ "-1year", "1 year" ]

With this in place in the _config.yaml_ clicking on a graph will show the 5 intervals
defined above of that graph

Full Screen Displays?
---------------------

You can reuse your dashboards for big displays against a wall in your NOC or office
by using the following url structure:

    http://gdash.example.com/dashboard/email/full/4/600/300
    http://gdash.example.com/dashboard/email/full/4?width=600&height=300

This will display the _email_ dashboard in _4_ columns each graph with a width of
_600_ and a height of _300_

The screen will refresh every minute
